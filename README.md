## Getting started

### Step 1: Clone repository
Clone the project repository from your terminal:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/merybal/delila-resto.git
```
or directly from GitHub.

### Step 2: Install dependencies
Download and install Node.js on your computer.

Access from your terminal the directory where you stored the repository on your computer and type:
```
$ npm i dependency-name
```
for each one of the dependencies.

### Step 3: Set JWT password
Open /configurations/configurations.js and replace string  ```‘insertYourKey’```  with your preferred password, and save.

### Step 4: Setting up the data base
Download and install XAMPP on your computer.

Open XAMPP control panel and check that it is running through the ```3306``` port.

Start Apache and MySQL.
From your browser, access the URL ```http://localhost/phpmyadmin/``` .

Create your data base using the file /data-base/queries.sql, either by importing the file or copying the queries to the SQL panel.

IMPORTANT: The initial queries insert an example into each table, including the first user, that has admin privileges. Any user created from then on will not have admin privileges, you’ll have to provide them manually as instructed on the documentation.  

### Step 5: Run server
On your terminal, access /server and type
```
$ node server.js
```
to run your server.

### Step 6: Use the API!
Server is up and running!
